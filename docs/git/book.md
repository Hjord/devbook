## Comments
Like HTML comments, if output is HTML.

```
<!---
a comment
-->
```
### Markdown

```
[comment]: <> (This is a comment, it will not be included)
[comment]: <> (in  the output file unless you use it in)
[comment]: <> (a reference style link.)
```
or
```
[//]: <> (This is also a comment.
```
or

```
(empty line)
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
```
